                As part of Last Meal on Earth: The End of Eating, our weeklong package dedicated to food, we wanted to establish, once and for all, the absolute best fast food items in America. The 'Ringer' staff participated in a two-step vote—first establishing more than 100 nominees, then holding a general election. (Condiments were disqualified from contention.) Below you'll find our final results. We're prepared for your complaints.
